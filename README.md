##BudgetBuddy by Jason Dyer

BudgetBuddy is a Python Tkinter GUI application designed for young adults (ages 18â€“30) to manage their monthly income and expenses. It provides a user-friendly interface to add transactions, view financial summaries, and track remaining balances. 

Key features include:
A main dashboard displaying total income, expenses, and balance.
A transaction entry window for adding income or expense records.
A transaction history window to review all entries.
Robust input validation to ensure accurate data entry.
Modular code structure with clear navigation and secure coding practices.

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system (includes Tkinter by default).
Download or clone the project files to a local directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:

No additional libraries are required, the application uses only the standard Python library.
